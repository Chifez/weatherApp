## Weather App
- This is a React based Responsive weather web application

### How it works 

- This weather app employs a 2 way data fetching system
    - On initial load it uses Javascript Geolocation API to get the
      location of it's user and in turn fetches the weather data
  
    - The user can also search for the weather condition of a 
      particular city or state
